# openapi-class-model

This repository includes 2 class diagrams created with PlantUML, one describing the [OpenAPI 3 Class Model](./jsonSchemaClassModel.png), and one describing the [JSON Schema Class Model](./openapiClassModel.png).

These diagrams are aids I created to describe the languages. I have simplified things where complicated to better describe the intent of the languages. If you want to code in the languages, reference the relevant documentation, and not these diagrams.

The official documentation can be found here:
